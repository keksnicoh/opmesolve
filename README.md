# [Q]uantum open system within [optical] regime
For my master thesis I create this lib as a basic framework
to perform GPU computations on different open quantum systems
within optical regime.

## Roadmap

- Defining an API using QuTip `mesolve` as reference.
- Implement a second kernel using plain numpy operation (also as reference).
- Implement an OpenCL kernel to parallelize the system in eigenbase on GPU.

## run tests

```bash
pytest .
```
